# Micah's Calculator
A little Android app where I use the Shunting Yard Algorithm along with Reverse Polish Notation to calculate all the things.

The apk is located under app/build/outputs/apk.

Known bugs:
- Back button working improperly

NOTE: This is an Android Studio 2.2.3 project. You may encounter some issues if you attempt to import this project on an earlier version of Android Studio.
