# Micah's Calculator
A little Android app where I use the Shunting Yard Algorithm along with Reverse Polish Notation to calculate all the things. 

Known bugs:
- Freezing when using non-integers in calculation.
- Not evaluating multiple digits, will only consider digit farthest right. Ex: 10 + 1 will result in 1, app only considers the   0 in 10.

NOTE: This is an Android Studio 2.2.3 project. You may encounter some issues if you attempt to import this project on an earlier version of Android Studio.
